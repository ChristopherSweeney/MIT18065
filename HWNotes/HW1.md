1. We reccommend use of Jupyter notebooks
  * You can log into [juliabox](http://www.juliabox.org) and avoid installation, but many students like having a local version of Julia.
  * If you have jupyter installed, you can open a new notebook by typing in the REPL (the Julia terminal) <br>
     `using IJulia` <br>
     `notebook()`
